These are the issues we have with Prebuild:

* vs2005 target 
   * does not honour localCopy=False - fairly easy to add <Private> node on ref. ** fixed **
   * screws up solution file projects references by miscalculating relative dir (it walks one level too high up then back) **fixed**
* Nant target
   * doesn't honour Output redirection at all, which causes everything to land in {project}/bin/Debug **fixed**
   
Both targets
   * Have problems with refs
     * 'System.Xml' will have to csc ref as 'System.Xml.dll' to work on Windows
     * but if you add dll, you end up with stuff like 'System.Xml.dll.dll.'

These things need fixing in the Prebuild source. Now, the good news is that prebuild is very straight forward, so we should be able to fix what we need in the tool and submit the changes to the Prebuild team.
