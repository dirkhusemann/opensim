TODO
	Anyone is free to take on one of these projects
	since implementations offer differ in results
	the more the merrier.

	New Generators
	
	* Musgraves multifractal suite
		* Hybrid Multifractal
		* Ridged Multifractal
		* Heterogenous procedural terrain
		
		Example implementation:
			http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~ebertd/texture/1stEdition/musgrave/musgrave.c
		
	* Ken Perlin's noise functions
		* Perlin noise
			* Original
			* Improved versions
			
	* Port the libnoise.sourceforge.net generators
	
	* Cellular / Organic Generators
		**ADDED CELLULAR.CS** // Adam Frisby <adam@deepthink.com.au> (20/03/2007)   
	
	* Finish porting the procedurality code in
		/branches/proceduality/
	  currently Java, but porting is easy enough
	  mostly a case of find/search/replace.
			
	Improvements
	
	* HillPlanter.cs
		* Add rectangular & square hills
	
	* Voronoi.cs
		* Add different distance metrics
			Currently using Eulicidean distance
			Want:
				* Manhattan Distance
				* Camberra Distance
				* Chebychev Distance
