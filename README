Some basic instructions on how to use OpenSim/OGS for hackers and geeks
-------------------------------------------------

1.First, either get in touch with a grid owner or install the OGS server components on your own server.
2.Ask the grid owner to send you keys over a secure channel (encrypted email, paper mail, phone, encrypted IM/IRC). If you and the grid owner are not concerned about security (YOU SHOULD BE!!!) then this exchange can be done over any communications channel.
3.Edit src/Config.cs to reflect your changes or if the grid owner has provided you with a template/custom database, drop opensim.yap into bin/
4.If you edited src/Config.cs then run "nant build" at the root directory
5.With mono on Linux/BSD cd into bin/ and run "mono OpenSim.exe", On win32 just run OpenSim.exe
5.Login to the grid with a standard viewer and find your sim (note that at certain times the SVN version does not allow logins)
