RUNNING SANDBOX MODE (the standard way)

To get up and running in sandbox mode, please start up opensim like this from the command line:

(first ensure you are in the right directory)

OpenSim.exe -sandbox (windows)

mono OpenSim.exe -sandbox (linux/BSD/MacOS X)

Then startup your second life viewer with the following parameters:

-loginuri http://yourserver:9000/

The method to do this is dependent upon your OS. "yourserver" will be 127.0.0.1 if you accept the defaults when starting opensim.


RUNNING SANDBOX WITH USER ACCOUNTS

* open cmd window, go to /bin and launch 
OpenSim.exe -sandbox -loginserver -useraccounts

* launch web browser, go to
http://localhost:9000/Admin
enter password 'Admin'

* Select 'Accounts', enter credentials, press 'Create'

* Now, log on thru your viewer (see above) with your newly created credentials.

* Have Fun!


PREBUILD

We use Prebuild to generate vs2005 solutions and nant build scripts.

=== Building Prebuild ===

At the moment, the Prebuild exe is shipped as /bin/Prebuild.exe so you shouldn't really have to build it.

But here's the instructions anyway :

The Prebuild master project is /prebuild.xml

To build it with vs2005 :

* build the solution /Prebuild/Prebuild.sln

To build it with nant :

* cd to /Prebuild/
* type 'nant'

After you've built it, it will land in the root /bin/ directory,

=== Modyfying the OpenSim solution ===

When adding or changing projects, modify the prebuild.xml and then execute

bin/Prebuild.exe /target {target}

where target is either 
vs2005 - to generate new vs2005 solutions and projects
nant - to generate new nant build scripts

Remember to run prebuild whenever you've added or removed files as well.
