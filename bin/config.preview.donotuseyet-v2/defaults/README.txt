README

This directory constains files which show the built-in defaults for settings within OpenSimulator.  Changing these
files directly will have no effect.

If you want to change any of these defaults, please either 

(a) Copy the *.ini.default file into config/override/*.ini.  
For instance, if you wanted to change the [Chat] settings in region.ini.defaults you would copy 
region.ini.defaults into config/override/region.ini

or

(b) Copy and paste the .ini.defaults section directly into config/OpenSim.ini.  For instance, 
if you want to change a [Chat] setting then copy the text in region.ini.defaults into config/OpenSim.ini
