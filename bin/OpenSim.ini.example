[ScriptEngine.DotNetEngine]
;
; These settings are specific to DotNetEngine script engine
; Other script engines based on OpenSim.Region.ScriptEngine.Common.dll will have almost identical settings, but in another section of this config file.
;

; When a script receives an event the event is queued.
; Any free thread will start executing this event. One script can only have one event executed simultaneously.
; If you have only one thread, and one script has a loop or does a lot of work, then no other scripts can run at the same time.
; Same if you have 10 threads, then only 10 scripts can be run simultaneously. 
; But because most scripts exit after their task, the threads are free to go on to the next script.

; Refresh ScriptEngine config options (these settings) every xx seconds
; 0 = Do not refresh
; Set it to number of seconds between refresh, for example 30.
; Will allow you to change ScriptEngine settings while server is running just by using "CONFIG SET" on console
; For example to increase or decrease number of threads: CONFIG SET NumberOfScriptThreads 10
; NOTE! Disabled for now. Feature does not work.
RefreshConfig=0

; Number of threads to use for script event execution
; Threads are shared across all regions
NumberOfScriptThreads=2

; Script event execution thread priority inside application.
; Valid values: Lowest, BelowNormal, Normal, AboveNormal, Highest
ScriptThreadPriority=BelowNormal

; How long MAX should a script event be allowed to run (per event execution)?
; Do not set this too low (like 50ms) as there are some time wasted in simply executing a function
; There is also a small speed penalty for every kill that is made
MaxEventExecutionTimeMs=5000

; Should we enable the max script event execution thread to look for scripts that exceed their timeslice?
EnforceMaxEventExecutionTime=true

; Should we stop the script completely when time exceeds?
; This is useful if you have a high <MaxEventExecutionTimeMs> and want to deactivate scripts that go wrong
; Note that for example physics engine can slow down the system and make scripts spend more time
DeactivateScriptOnTimeout=false

; If no scripts have executed in this pass how long should we sleep before checking again
; Impact:
; Too low and you will waste lots of CPU
; Too high and people touching object or similar will have to wait up to this amount of time before script responding
SleepTimeIfNoScriptExecutionMs=50

; AppDomains are used for two things:
; * Security: Scripts inside AppDomains are limited in permissions. 
; * Script unloading: When a script is deactivated it can not be unloaded. Only whole AppDomains can be unloaded.
;                     AppDomains are therefore only unloaded once ALL active scripts inside it has been deactivated (removed from prims).
; Each AppDomain has some memory overhead. But leaving dead scripts in memory also has memory overhead.

; (if 2 then function will be executed every MaintenanceLoopms*2 ms)
; Script loading/unloading

; How long load/unload thread should sleep if there is nothing to do
; Higher value makes it respond slower when scripts are added/removed from prims
; But once active it will process all in queue before sleeping again
