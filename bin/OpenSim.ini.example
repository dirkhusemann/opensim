    ; will actually push down data at a maximum rate of 750 kilobits per second).
    ; 
    ; In principle, setting a multiplier greater than 1 will allow data to be pushed down to a client much faster
    ; than its UI allows the setting to go.  This may be okay in some situations, such as standalone OpenSim
    ; applications on a LAN.  However, the greater the multipler, the higher the risk of packet drop, resulting
    ; in symptoms such as missing terrain or objects.  A much better solution is to change the client UI to allow

    ;
    ; Currently this setting is 2 by default because we currently send much more texture data than is strictly
