; When a script receives an event the event is queued.
; Any free thread will start executing this event. One script can only have one event executed simultaneously.
; If you have only one thread, and one script has a loop or does a lot of work, then no other scripts can run at the same time.
; Same if you have 10 threads, then only 10 scripts can be run simultaneously. 
; But because most scripts exit after their task, the threads are free to go on to the next script.

; Number of threads to use for script event execution
; Threads are shared across all regions
NumberOfScriptThreads=2

; Script event execution thread priority inside application.
; Valid values: Lowest, BelowNormal, Normal, AboveNormal, Highest
ScriptThreadPriority=BelowNormal

; Should the script threads be private for each region?
; true: Each region will get <NumberOfScriptThreads> dedicated to scripts within that region
;       Number of threads will be <NumberOfScriptThreads>*<NumberOfRegions>
; false: All regions share <NumberOfScriptThreads> for all their scripts
PrivateRegionThreads=false

; How long MAX should a script event be allowed to run (per event execution)?
; Do not set this too low (like 50ms) as there are some time wasted in simply executing a function
; There is also a small speed penalty for every kill that is made
MaxEventExecutionTimeMs=5000

; Should we enable the max script event execution thread to look for scripts that exceed their timeslice?
EnforceMaxEventExecutionTime=true

; Should we stop the script completely when time exceeds?
; This is useful if you have a high <MaxEventExecutionTimeMs> and want to deactivate scripts that go wrong
; Note that for example physics engine can slow down the system and make scripts spend more time
DeactivateScriptOnTimeout=false

; If no scripts have executed in this pass how long should we sleep before checking again
; Impact:
; Too low and you will waste lots of CPU
; Too high and people touching object or similar will have to wait up to this amount of time before script responding
