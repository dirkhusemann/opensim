This is a fork of TestClient from the main libsl project, it is not built as a normal part of the opensim release and is designed to allow migration of avatars from the main LL grid to an OGS system.

It's essentially a "good CopyBot" - before an avatar is copied consent is taken and the avatar data is exported out to the remote grid via a web service. The bot is designed to be evoked remotely via an LSL script in-world.
